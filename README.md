## Overview

KipuBank is a secure smart contract that implements a decentralized banking system on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can deposit ETH into personal vaults and withdraw funds with built-in security measures and transaction limits.

## Contract Information

**Network**: Sepolia Testnet  
**Contract Address**: `0x979CCD0EB9Bcfc4Bbad9D85914D4C20Edbee3a8B`  
**Block Explorer**: [View on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x979CCD0EB9Bcfc4Bbad9D85914D4C20Edbee3a8B)  
**Deployment Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Verified and Published

## Features

- **Personal ETH Vaults**: Users can deposit native ETH into individual accounts
- **Withdrawal Limits**: Maximum 0.1 ETH per transaction withdrawal limit
- **Global Deposit Cap**: Total bank capacity of 10 ETH
- **Transaction Tracking**: Monitors total deposits and withdrawals
- **Security First**: Implements checks-effects-interactions pattern
- **Gas Optimized**: Uses short strings and single storage access patterns
- **Safe Transfers**: Secure ETH transfers with proper error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Contract Architecture

#### Immutable Variables
- `WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT`: 100000000000000000 wei (0.1 ETH)
- `BANK_CAP`: 10000000000000000000 wei (10 ETH)

#### State Variables
- `owner`: Contract deployer address
- `totalDeposited`: Total ETH currently in the bank
- `totalDeposits`: Counter of successful deposits
- `totalWithdrawals`: Counter of successful withdrawals
- `balances`: Mapping of user addresses to their balances

#### Events
- `Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount, uint256 newBalance)`
- `Withdrawal(address indexed user, uint256 amount, uint256 newBalance)`

#### Security Features
- **Single storage access**: Each variable read only once per function for gas optimization
- **Short strings**: All error messages are concise (e.g., "Zero deposit", "Cap exceeded")
- **Checks-effects-interactions pattern**: Proper validation, state changes, then external calls
- **Safe ETH transfers**: Using `call` method with success verification
- **Input validation**: Modifiers ensure valid parameters

## Module 2 Compliance

This contract strictly follows **Module 2** curriculum requirements:

### ✅ **Critical Requirements Met:**
- **No long strings**: All `require()` messages are short (under 15 characters)
- **Single storage access**: Each state variable accessed only once per function
- **Module 2 concepts only**: Uses only techniques taught in the module

### ✅ **Gas Optimizations:**
- Short error strings save ~50-100 gas per error
- Single storage access saves ~200 gas per avoided SLOAD operation
- Efficient event emission using calculated values

## How to Test the Contract (For Instructors)

The KipuBank contract is deployed and verified on Sepolia Testnet. You can interact with it directly through Etherscan without needing to deploy your own instance.

### Prerequisites for Testing

2. Click on the **"Contract"** tab
3. You'll see the verified source code and contract functions

#### Step 2: Read Contract Functions (No Gas Required)
Click on **"Read Contract"** to view current state:

**Available Read Functions:**
- `WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT` → Returns: 100000000000000000 (0.1 ETH)
- `BANK_CAP` → Returns: 10000000000000000000 (10 ETH)
- `owner` → Returns: Contract deployer address
- `totalDeposited` → Returns: Current total ETH in bank
- `totalDeposits` → Returns: Number of deposits made
- `totalWithdrawals` → Returns: Number of withdrawals made
- `getBalance` → Input: user address → Returns: user's balance
- `getBankInfo` → Returns: All bank statistics at once

#### Step 3: Write Contract Functions (Requires Gas)
Click on **"Write Contract"** and connect your MetaMask:

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Click "Connect to Web3"
   - Select MetaMask and approve connection
   - Ensure you're on Sepolia Testnet

2. **Test Deposit Function**
   - Find the `deposit` function
   - Enter amount in ETH (e.g., 0.01) in "payableAmount (ether)" field
   - Click "Write" and confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - Wait for confirmation

3. **Verify Deposit**
   - Go back to "Read Contract"
   - Use `getBalance` with your wallet address
   - Check `totalDeposited` and `totalDeposits` counters

4. **Test Withdrawal Function**
   - In "Write Contract", find `withdraw` function
   - Enter amount in wei (e.g., 10000000000000000 for 0.01 ETH)
   - Click "Write" and confirm transaction
   - Verify transaction in your MetaMask activity

### Test Scenarios for Module 2 Compliance

#### Scenario 1: Normal Deposit
```
Action: Deposit 0.01 ETH
Expected: Success, balance increases, event emitted
Error: None (should succeed)
```

#### Scenario 2: Zero Deposit (Should Fail)
```
Action: Deposit 0 ETH
Expected: Transaction fails with "Zero deposit" (short string)
Gas: Minimal (fails early in validation)
```

#### Scenario 3: Exceed Bank Cap (Should Fail)
```
Action: Deposit more than remaining capacity
Expected: Transaction fails with "Cap exceeded" (short string)
Gas: Minimal (single storage read for validation)
```

#### Scenario 4: Normal Withdrawal
```
Action: Withdraw 0.01 ETH (after depositing)
Expected: Success, balance decreases, ETH received
Error: None (should succeed)
```

#### Scenario 5: Exceed Withdrawal Limit (Should Fail)
```
Action: Withdraw more than 0.1 ETH
Expected: Transaction fails with "Limit exceeded" (short string)
Gas: Minimal (fails early in validation)
```

#### Scenario 6: Insufficient Balance (Should Fail)
```
Action: Withdraw more than your balance
Expected: Transaction fails with "Low balance" (short string)
Gas: Minimal (single storage read for validation)
```

### Contract Parameters

- **Withdrawal Limit**: 0.1 ETH per transaction
- **Bank Capacity**: 10 ETH total
- **Owner**: Contract deployer (can be checked in Read Contract)

### Gas Efficiency Validation

**Module 2 Optimizations Applied:**

## Instructor Testing Guide

### Quick Testing Steps on Etherscan

1. **Access Contract**: Go to [sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x979CCD0EB9Bcfc4Bbad9D85914D4C20Edbee3a8B](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x979CCD0EB9Bcfc4Bbad9D85914D4C20Edbee3a8B)

2. **Verify Module 2 Compliance** (Read Contract):
   - Check `WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT` → Should return: `100000000000000000`
   - Check `BANK_CAP` → Should return: `10000000000000000000`
   - Use `getBankInfo()` → Returns all stats in one call (gas efficient)

3. **Test Deposit** (Write Contract):
   - Connect MetaMask to Sepolia
   - Use `deposit()` with 0.01 ETH
   - Verify short error messages if testing edge cases

4. **Test Withdrawal** (Write Contract):
   - Use `withdraw()` with amount in wei (e.g., 10000000000000000 for 0.01 ETH)
   - Verify single storage access pattern in transaction logs

5. **Validate Gas Efficiency**:
   - Check transaction gas usage
   - Compare failed transactions (should use minimal gas due to early validation)

### Module 2 Validation Points

**✅ Short Strings Verification:**
- Try depositing 0 ETH → Should fail with "Zero deposit" (12 chars)
- Try exceeding cap → Should fail with "Cap exceeded" (12 chars)
- Try exceeding limit → Should fail with "Limit exceeded" (14 chars)

**✅ Single Storage Access Verification:**
- Check transaction logs for minimal SLOAD operations
- Each state variable should be read only once per function

### Important Notes for Testing

- **Gas Fees**: All write functions require Sepolia ETH
- **Wei Conversion**: Use online converters or: 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Wait for block confirmation before proceeding
- **Event Logs**: Check transaction receipts for emitted events
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Wait for transaction confirmation before proceeding
- **Event Logs**: Check transaction logs for emitted events (`Deposit`, `Withdrawal`)
